PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This is the AirBnB clone project. The console is developed by using the cmd module in python which is similar to the shell in linux for the interaction with the users.
The data is serialised and deserialised to and from respectively thr JSON file.


THE COMMAND LINE INTERPRETER
>How To Start it
You can get a copy of the source code into your local machine and set it up and running

>How To Use it
It works in both the interactive and the non interactive mode.
In the interactive mode, the console recieves the user's input in reads them by loooping over them as in line command reading and executes them.

In the non interactive mode, the user has to input the command which will be piped into its execution so that the command runs as soon as the console starts.


EXAMPLES
One can run commands like:
> help tp show the documented and non documented quick commands
> help quit - to view the work of the quit command
> EOF to terminate the console.
> And so on
